This directory contains a reproducible, cryptographically verifiable evidence bundle
showing authorship and evolution of this project over time.

## What this is
- A structured set of artifacts (docs, logs, recordings, outputs)
- Git provenance exports (commit history, tags, refs)
- A ZIP bundle with SHA-256 hash + manifest file

## How to create the bundle
From repo root:
```bash
python scripts/make_evidence_bundle.py
